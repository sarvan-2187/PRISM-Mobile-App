 * `authorization_stage` is a Postgres enum, so a new stage has to exist in the
 * type before a row can name it. Adding it here rather than in the web
 * backend's migrations keeps the mobile feature self-contained: the web stack
 * neither knows nor cares that this value exists, and `npm run db:reset` on
 * that side is unaffected.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction (`IF NOT EXISTS`), so it runs on every boot and
 * survives a database reset without anyone remembering to re-run anything.
